::: notes
- Emomis project, Jula, Apeksha
- not focus on our science, but feature it too
- focus on the most fascinating things I've learnt in this project
- focus on things I've changed my mind about, a bit provocative, there's also things I think are a problem. 
- many more myths I would have liked to bust, let's talk more if you are interested!
:::


## Myth 1: People are gullible

:::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}
- People are easy to manipulate


### Solutions?
- Facts!
- Make them more skeptical


### The Science:

## Myth 3: There's a lot of misinformation

:::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
### Solutions?

- Reduce it & warn people

### The Science:

- Only 1-6% of all news.
- Most people don't read the news.

## Myth 4: Misinformation influences behavior

:::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
- Strong effects on opinions and behavior.

### Solutions?

- Reduce it, facts, warnings...

### The Science

- Disinformation attacks: no effects on voting
- Bail Russian bots study
- Even the mass media have [small effects at best](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-35576-9)

## Myth 5: It's algorithms & echo chambers!

:::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
- Algorithms radicalise people
- Echo chambers cause polarization

### Solutions?

- [Reduce](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/37/9216) echo chambers
- [Turn off](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.abp9364) the algorithms

### The Science:

- No algorithm effects on opinions & affective polarization.
- Echo chambers are [larger offline](https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjr044), [reducing them backfires](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/37/9216).

### Misinformation myths

-   People are gullible
-   Emotions make people irrational
-   People are exposed to a lot of misinformation
-   Misinformation has strong effects on behavior
-   Algorithms radicalize people
-   Echo chambers cause the problem

### Truth

- It's hard to change people's minds
- Emotions are functional
- Misinformation (and news) exposure are low
- Persuasion has very small effects
- Algorithms are not an all round solution
- Dissolving echo chambers causes polarization

### Wrong solutions

- reduce misinformation 
- reduce emotions
- make people more skeptical
- reduce echo chambers

### So what is the problem?

-   Reducing misinformation will not make the real problems go away (vaccine hesitancy, ethnic tensions, sexism, racism, polarization)
-   Misinformation as the scapegoat
-   Alarmist narratives reduce trust in reliable news

### Doing the hard work:

-   Improve democratic & medical institutions
-   Improve the media
-   Address misinformation from the top
