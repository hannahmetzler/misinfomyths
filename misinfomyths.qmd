::: notes

### Misinformation myths

-   People are gullible
-   Emotions make people irrational
-   People are exposed to a lot of misinformation
-   Misinformation has strong effects on behavior
-   Algorithms radicalize people
-   Echo chambers cause the problem

### Truth

- It's hard to change people's minds
- Emotions are functional
- Misinformation (and news) exposure are low
- Persuasion has very small effects
- Algorithms are not an allround solution
- Dissolving echo chambers causes polarization

### Wrong solutions

- reduce misinformation 
- reduce emotions
- make people more skeptical
- reduce echo chambers

### So what is the problem?

-   Reducing misinformation will not make the real problems go away (vaccine hesitancy, ethnic tensions, sexism, racism, polarization)
-   Misinformation as the scapegoat
-   Alarmist narratives reduce trust in reliable news

### Doing the hard work:

-   Improve democratic & medical institutions
-   Improve the media
-   Address misinformation from the top
